	Question: Does increased competition lead to greater participation
	in PR systems? Goal: Explain why we observe higher turnout in PR
	systems. Theory: Borrows from Cox (1999), the "pivotal elites model."
	Parties observe that resources are well-spent in some districts,
	but "wasted" in others. This leads to great variation in the mobilization
	efforts of parties acorss districts in SMD systems. PR systems on
	the other hand are competed for in larger districts, giving parties
	the incentive to mobilize all citizens. Concepts: Nothing to deep
	here Unit of analysis: District Actors: parties and citizens who
	respond Implications: higher turnout in more competitive districts,
	greater variation in turnout across districts in SMD systems. DV:
	turnout, district level IV(s): threshold of exclusion, district margin
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: (1) Greater turnout in closer elections, (2)
	mobilization and turnout more variable in SMD systems, (3) no difference
	between PR and SMD, competitiveness held constant, (4) ower turnout
	with higher threshold of exclusion, and (5-7) suprdistrict corrections
	produce higher turnout, weaker effect of competitiveness, lower cross-district
	variation. Empirical strategy: Mixed Heteroskedastic Logit. It seems
	that given lower turnout in SMD systems, the variation cannot help
	but be greater. It seems that the structure of the systems themselves
	might be producing these results. It seems like he could have the
	causal arrow backward. Test adequecy: I don't know enough about this
	model to say. Measurement validity: I am not sure that his construct
	of district competitiveness makes much sense. I need to at least
	think about this some more. Case selection: CSES data
	
	FINDINGS
	
	The observed difference in turnout is due to local competition.
